Inversion-model-of-amplitude
====
These are the four amplitude inversion models. Each folder contains the matalb-code and the training set. 
# CNN
Run the main.m
# MLP
Run the main.m
# RF
* Install the RF toolbox in the matlab. 
* Run the main.m
# SVM
* Install the SVM toolbox in the matlab.
* The Wenchang in the folder is the prediction set. 
* The training set is included in the Wenchang. Run the code in the folder. The specific methods to achieve the following: 1. Load data 2. Adjust parameters 3. Run 4. Save 5. Open the saved data and the inversion results is in the pretest.
* NOTE: The inversion result is the ratio of amplitude to water depth, and the amplitude value should be the product of the inversion result and water depth.
